/**
 * Locks the **wire key** written by [ActionSummarySpanExporter].
 *
 * `ActionSummarySpanExporterTest` asserts through [RumConstants.APP_ACTION_SUMMARY_KEY], so it
 * stays green if the constant's string value is reverted or mistyped — the emitted name is the
 * actual contract with dashboards and alerts, and nothing else pins it down.
 *
 * The expected value below is a string literal rather than a reference to the constant it pins;
 * referring to the constant would reintroduce exactly the blind spot this test exists to close.
 *
 * Companion to `MetricsWireKeyContractTest` — same rationale, same shape.
