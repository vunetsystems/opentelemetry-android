# Android Instrumentation for URLConnection, HttpURLConnection and HttpsURLConnection

Status: development

The OpenTelemetry HttpUrlConnection instrumentation for Android will automatically
instrument client-side usage of:

- [URLConnection](https://developer.android.com/reference/java/net/URLConnection)
- [HttpURLConnection](https://developer.android.com/reference/java/net/HttpURLConnection)
- [HttpsURLConnection](https://developer.android.com/reference/javax/net/ssl/HttpsURLConnection)

The instrumentation operates by intercepting application calls to the APIs that
initiate or read from network connections. It performs three primary actions:

- adds distributed tracing context to outgoing requests
- creates and ends client HTTP spans
- records request/response metadata and exceptions

[See the Android URLConnection documentation](https://developer.android.com/reference/java/net/URLConnection) for reference.

## Telemetry

This instrumentation produces HTTP client spans using the OpenTelemetry HTTP semantic
conventions. The instrumentation scope (instrumentation library name) is
`io.opentelemetry.android.http-url-connection`.

### HTTP client span

This instrumentation creates a span for each HTTP request. Spans are ended when one of
the following occurs: the response stream is fully read, the stream is closed,
`disconnect()` is called, or an exception occurs while interacting with the connection.

- Type: Span
- Name: Determined by the HTTP span name extractor (typically `HTTP {method}` or derived from the URL)
- Description: Client-side HTTP request
- Attributes (following OpenTelemetry [HTTP semantic conventions](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/http/http-spans/)):
  - `http.request.method` — request method (GET, POST, etc.)
  - `url.full` — full request URL
  - `url.scheme`, `url.path`, `url.query` — parts of the request URL when available
  - `http.response.status_code` — response status code
  - `network.protocol.version` — protocol version (e.g. `1.1`, `2` for HTTP/2)
  - `server.address` — logical server host
  - `server.port` — logical server port
  - `network.peer.address` / `network.peer.port` — connection endpoint, when available
  - Request and response headers captured according to configuration: `http.request.header.<name>` / `http.response.header.<name>`

If the request throws an IOException, the span is ended and the exception is recorded. Failed spans
include a normalized `http.error.category` attribute alongside the standard `error.type` attribute:

| `http.error.category` | When |
|-----------------------|------|
| `timeout` | Connect/read/write timeout (`SocketTimeoutException`, `InterruptedIOException`) |
| `dns` | DNS resolution failure (`UnknownHostException`) |
| `ssl` | TLS or certificate failure (`SSLException`, `CertificateException`) |
| `io` | Other transport I/O failure (`IOException`) |
| `http_client` | HTTP 4xx/5xx response with no transport exception |
| `unknown` | Other failure types |

Use `http.response.status_code` to distinguish 4xx vs 5xx when `http.error.category` is `http_client`.

#### Status code when no response was received

When a request fails before any response arrives, the OpenTelemetry HTTP attributes extractor omits
`http.response.status_code` entirely, which is indistinguishable downstream from a request that was
never instrumented. This instrumentation fills that gap:

| Failure | Exception | `http.response.status_code` |
|---------|-----------|-----------------------------|
| DNS resolution failure | `UnknownHostException` | `0` |
| Connection refused / no route | `ConnectException`, `NoRouteToHostException` | `0` |
| TLS handshake failure | `SSLHandshakeException` (including a wrapped `CertificateException`) | `0` |
| Timeout | `SocketTimeoutException`, `InterruptedIOException` | *absent* |
| Failure after the server answered | `FileNotFoundException` (any response `>= 400`), `SocketException("Connection reset")` mid-body | actual status (`404`, `500`, …) |
| Any other failure | — | *absent* |
| Response received (any status) | — | actual status (`200`, `404`, `500`, …) |

Reporting `0` asserts "the request never reached the server", so the match is on the specific
exception types that prove it — **not** on the coarse `http.error.category` buckets above. The `io`
category maps *any* unmatched `IOException`, which includes failures proving the opposite: an HTTP/2
`StreamResetException` means the server sent the reset, and a connection reset mid-body means it had
already answered. Everything outside the pre-request set keeps the attribute absent:

* **Timeouts** — the request may well have reached the server and been processed; the response
  simply did not arrive in time.
* **Failures after the server answered** — `0` would be a lie, and so would *absent*.
  `HttpURLConnection.getInputStream()` raises `FileNotFoundException` for any response `>= 400`, so
  a plain 404 reaches the instrumentation on the throwable path. `reportWithThrowable` asks the
  connection for the code it already holds rather than reporting the `-1` sentinel, so the real
  `404`/`500` is recorded alongside the error. When the request genuinely never reached a server
  there is no code to retrieve and the sentinel still applies.
* **Unrecognised failures** — by definition it is not known whether the server was reached, which
  is exactly where claiming "never got there" is least defensible.

> **Note:** reporting `0` is a deliberate deviation from the OpenTelemetry semantic conventions,
> which leave `http.response.status_code` unset when no response was received.

### Network timing (incubating, best-effort)

When `captureNetworkTiming` is enabled (default `true`), HttpURLConnection spans include total
request duration only. HttpURLConnection cannot expose DNS/TCP/TLS/TTFB phase breakdown; use
[`okhttp3-library`](../okhttp3/README.md) instrumentation for full phase timing.

| Signal | Value |
|--------|-------|
| `http.client.timing.total_ms` | Wall-clock ms from first traced hook to span end |
| `http.client.timing.phases_supported` | `false` |
| Span event `http.call` | `{ duration_ms: <total_ms> }` |

Disable timing capture:

```java
HttpUrlInstrumentation instrumentation =
    AndroidInstrumentationLoader.getInstrumentation(HttpUrlInstrumentation.class);
instrumentation.setCaptureNetworkTiming(false);
```

### Configuration impact on telemetry

You can customize which request and response headers are captured and other behavior via
the `HttpUrlInstrumentation` setters exposed through `AndroidInstrumentationLoader`.
These settings are applied when `HttpUrlConnectionSingletons.configure(...)` is called
during instrumentation setup. See the `Configurations` section above for how to access
the instrumentation instance.

### Distributed tracing propagation

The instrumentation injects the configured context propagators into the request using
request properties (via a TextMap setter), allowing distributed tracing across services.

## Quickstart

### Overview

This plugin enhances the Android application host code by instrumenting all critical APIs (specifically those that initiate a connection). It intercepts calls to these APIs to ensure the following actions are performed:

- Context is added for distributed tracing before actual API is called (i.e before connection is initiated).
- Traces and spans are generated and properly closed.
- Any exceptions thrown are recorded.

A span associated with a given request is concluded in the following scenarios:

- When the getInputStream()/getErrorStream() APIs are called, the span concludes after the stream is fully read, an IOException is encountered, or the stream is closed.
- When the disconnect API is called.

Spans won't be automatically ended and reported otherwise. If any of your URLConnection requests do not call the span concluding APIs mentioned above, refer the section entitled ["Scheduling Harvester Thread"](#scheduling-harvester-thread). This section provides guidance on setting up a recurring thread that identifies unreported, idle connections and ends/reports any open spans associated with them. Idle connections are those that have been read from previously but have been inactive for a particular configurable time interval (defaults to 10 seconds).

> The minimum supported Android SDK version is 23, though it will also instrument APIs added in the Android SDK version 26 when running on devices with API level 26 and above.
> If your project's minSdk is lower than 26, then you must enable
> [corelib desugaring](https://developer.android.com/studio/write/java8-support#library-desugaring).
>
> Further, in order to run the app built on debug, you need to add the following property in `gradle.properties` file:
>
> - If AGP <= 8.3.0, set `android.enableDexingArtifactTransform=false`
> - If AGP > 8.3.0, set `android.useFullClasspathForDexingTransform=true`
>
> For the full context for these workaround, please see
> [this issue](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/334281968) for AGP <= 8.3.0
> or [this issue](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/230454566#comment18) for AGP > 8.3.0.

### Add these dependencies to your project

Replace `BYTEBUDDY_VERSION` with the [latest release](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/net.bytebuddy/byte-buddy-gradle-plugin/versions).

#### Byte buddy compilation plugin

This plugin leverages Android's [Transform API](https://developer.android.com/reference/tools/gradle-api/current/com/android/build/api/variant/ScopedArtifactsOperation#toTransform(com.android.build.api.artifact.ScopedArtifact,kotlin.Function1,kotlin.Function1,kotlin.Function1)) to instrument bytecode at compile time. You can find more info on its [repo page](https://github.com/raphw/byte-buddy/tree/master/byte-buddy-gradle-plugin/android-plugin).

```groovy
plugins {
    id 'net.bytebuddy.byte-buddy-gradle-plugin' version 'BYTEBUDDY_VERSION'
}
```

#### Project dependencies

```kotlin
implementation("io.opentelemetry.android.instrumentation:httpurlconnection-library:1.3.0-alpha")
byteBuddy("io.opentelemetry.android.instrumentation:httpurlconnection-agent:1.3.0-alpha")
```

### Configurations

#### Scheduling Harvester Thread

To schedule a periodically running thread to conclude/report spans on any unreported, idle connections, add the below code in the function where your application starts ( that could be onCreate() method of first Activity/Fragment/Service):

```java
HttpUrlInstrumentation instrumentation = AndroidInstrumentationLoader.getInstrumentation(HttpUrlInstrumentation.class);
instrumentation.setConnectionInactivityTimeoutMs(customTimeoutValue); //This is optional. Replace customTimeoutValue with a long data type value which denotes the connection inactivity timeout in milli seconds. Defaults to 10000ms
Executors.newSingleThreadScheduledExecutor().scheduleWithFixedDelay(instrumentation.getReportIdleConnectionRunnable(), 0, instrumentation.getReportIdleConnectionInterval(), TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);
```

- `instrumentation.getReportIdleConnectionRunnable()` is the API to get the runnable.
- By default, connections inactive for 10000ms are reported. To optionally change the connection inactivity timeout call `instrumentation.setConnectionInactivityTimeoutMs(customTimeoutValue)` API as shown in above code snippet.
- It is efficient to run the harvester thread at the same time interval as the connection inactivity timeout used to identify the connections to be reported. `instrumentation.getReportIdleConnectionInterval()` is the API to get the same connection inactivity timeout interval (milliseconds) you have configured or the default value of 10000ms if not configured.

#### Other Optional Configurations

You can optionally configure the automatic instrumentation by using the setters from [HttpUrlInstrumentation](library/src/main/java/io/opentelemetry/instrumentation/library/httpurlconnection/HttpUrlInstrumentation.kt)
instance provided via the AndroidInstrumentationLoader as shown below:

```java
HttpUrlInstrumentation instrumentation = AndroidInstrumentationLoader.getInstrumentation(HttpUrlInstrumentation.class);

// Call `instrumentation` setters.
```

> [!NOTE]
> You must make sure to apply any configurations **before** initializing your OpenTelemetryRum
> instance (i.e. calling OpenTelemetryRum.builder()...build()). Otherwise your configs won't be
> taken into account during the RUM initialization process.

After adding the plugin and the dependencies to your project, and after doing the required configurations, your requests will be traced automatically.
