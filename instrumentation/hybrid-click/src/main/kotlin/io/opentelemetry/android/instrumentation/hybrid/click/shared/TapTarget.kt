/**
 * Normalized tap target metadata used to build hybrid click spans.
 *
 * [source] identifies where the target came from (`view` or `compose`).
 *
 * [checkedStateProvider] is supplied only when the target is a toggle (switch / checkbox / radio).
 * It is a deferred read of the live checked state rather than a captured value: the click span is
 * emitted before the touch is delegated to the underlying widget, so reading the state lazily (on
 * the next main-loop tick) reports the *resulting* state after the toggle flips.
