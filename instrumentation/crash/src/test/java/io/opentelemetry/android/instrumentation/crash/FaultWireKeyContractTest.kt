 * Locks the **wire keys** shared by the `device.crash` and `device.anr` signals.
 *
 * The behavioural tests for both signals assert through the `RumConstants` and semconv constants,
 * so they stay green if a constant's string value is reverted or mistyped — the emitted attribute
 * names are the actual contract with dashboards and alerts, and nothing else pins them down.
 *
 * Every expected value below is a string literal rather than a reference to the constant it pins;
 * referring to the constant would reintroduce exactly the blind spot this test exists to close.
 *
 * Companion to `AppStartWireKeyContractTest` in the activity module — same rationale, same shape.

     * That matters for the canonical migration, which renames `heap.free` to

     * would silently rename it here too, which is what this test exists to prevent.
