/**
 * Reports `http.response.status_code = 0` for calls that failed before any response arrived.
 *
 * The upstream HTTP attributes extractor only emits the status code when it is greater than zero,
 * so a failed call otherwise carries no status at all and is indistinguishable downstream from a
 * request that was never instrumented. This extractor fills the gap for client-side failures that
 * never reached the server (DNS, connection refused, TLS) — see
 * [HttpErrorCategory.reportsZeroStatusCode] for which categories qualify.
 *
 * **A null response does not mean no response arrived.** On the default path
 * (`captureNetworkTimingPhases = true`) the span is ended by `OkHttpCallCompletionCoordinator`,
 * which reports the response it recorded *alongside* any error — so a call that received a 200 and
 * then failed mid-body arrives here as `(Response(200), IOException)` and exits on the
 * `response != null` branch.
 *
 * A null response therefore means "no response was ever recorded", which still is not proof the
 * server went unreached: the failure may simply have landed before `chain.proceed()` returned. The
 * throwable is the only thing that separates the two, which is why
 * [HttpErrorCategory.reportsZeroStatusCode] matches pre-request failure types exactly rather than
 * treating any `IOException` as "never got there".
 *
 * **Cancelled calls are excluded.** OkHttp raises cancellation as a plain `IOException("Canceled")`.
 * Cancellation is routine on mobile — list scrolling, rapid navigation, a cancelled coroutine scope
 * — and can land after the request reached the server, so [okhttp3.Call.isCanceled] is checked
 * directly rather than inferred from the exception type.
 *
 * Note this deviates from the OpenTelemetry semantic conventions, which leave the attribute unset
 * when no response was received. It is intentional: the ingest contract distinguishes "reached the
 * server" from "never got there" by the presence of a zero status.
